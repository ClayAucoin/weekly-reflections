                <p>This week we learned how to use git bash. I’ve worked in the Linux Terminal and Windows CMD and have the basics down pretty well. But the same thing that has “blocked” me with those two in the past is the same thing that is getting me using git bash and that’s remembering the workflow of certain operations. For instance, to make a pull request to someone else’s GitHub. Now I understand that these operations are on the repo on GitHub but it’s still good to remember them.</p>

                <ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li>git clone “[https://url...](https://url)”</li>
                        <li>git checkout \-b \<branch-name\></branch-name></li>
                        <li>git add . \- after changes</li>
                        <li>git commit \-m “Commit message”</li>
                        <li>git push origin \<branch-name\></branch-name></li>
                        <li>Then go to the original Repository's GitHub and create a pull request.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>

                <p>Kind of a lot to remember if you don’t do this often. But I’m sure we’ll get the chance.</p>

                <p>Something else I had trouble with was using restore and revert properly under the exploring history chapter.</p>

                <p>Here is a screenshot of some of the notes I took in my OneNote notebook for this week.</p>
