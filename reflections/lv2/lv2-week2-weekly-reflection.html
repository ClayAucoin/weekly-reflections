            <p>This week we got into VS Code. Now weâ€™re getting into the good stuff. I really enjoyed learning how to use Emmet.</p>

            <div class="img"><img style="width: 75%;" src="images/lv2-week2-1.png" alt="Level 2 Week 2 - Working with Emmet"></div>

            <p>As far as blockers go, the only thing that gave me an issue was learning how to fix conflicts. I was worried that conflicts were going to hurt my grade until we learned that we could enter a config command</p>
